				component: `
The TeamVoteAction component handles the team approval voting phase of the game. All players simultaneously vote to approve or reject the proposed mission team.

### Voting Mechanics

- **Approve** ✓ - Support the proposed team composition
- **Reject** ✗ - Oppose the team and pass proposal to next player
- **Anonymous Until Complete** - Votes are hidden until all players vote
- **Majority Rules** - Team is approved if more than half vote approve

### UI Features

- **Team Display** - Shows which players are on the proposed team
- **Vote Status** - Indicates whether you've already voted
- **Proposal Counter** - Shows current proposal number (1-5)
- **Warning on 5th Vote** - The 5th proposal auto-approves (evil wins if team fails)

### Strategic Elements

Voting patterns reveal information:
- Evil players may coordinate to reject good teams
- Good players must balance suspicion with progress
- The 5th vote creates tension and forces decisions
- Vote timing can sometimes reveal alliances
