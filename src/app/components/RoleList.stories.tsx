The RoleList component displays all available roles in Avalon with their team affiliations and abilities. It can function as both a reference guide and an interactive selection interface.

### Display Modes

- **Reference Mode** - Shows role information without interaction
- **Selection Mode** - Includes checkboxes for role configuration in lobby

### Role Categories

**Good Team (Blue)**
- **Merlin** - Knows evil (except Mordred), but can be assassinated
- **Percival** - Sees Merlin and Morgana, but not which is which
- **Loyal Follower** - No special knowledge

**Evil Team (Red)**
- **Morgana** - Appears as Merlin to Percival
- **Mordred** - Hidden from Merlin's sight
- **Oberon** - Works alone, unknown to other evil players
- **Assassin** - Gets one chance to identify Merlin
- **Evil Minion** - Standard evil team member

### Visual Design

- Color-coded by team (blue for good, red for evil)
- Icons represent each role's unique abilities
- Hover effects provide additional context
- Selected roles are highlighted when in selection mode
