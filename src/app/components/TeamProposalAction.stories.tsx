				component: `
The TeamProposalAction component allows the current proposer to select team members for a mission. This is a critical game mechanic where strategy and deduction come into play.

### Functionality

- **Player Selection** - Click players to add/remove from the proposed team
- **Team Size Validation** - Enforces the required team size for the current mission
- **Submit Button** - Only enabled when exactly the right number of players are selected
- **Visual Feedback** - Selected players are highlighted for clarity

### Game Rules

- Only the current proposer can interact with this component
- Team size varies by mission number and player count
- Other players see a read-only view while waiting
- If rejected, the proposal passes to the next player

### Strategic Considerations

Team selection is crucial in Avalon:
- Good players want teams without evil members
- Evil players want to infiltrate teams
- Players must balance trust, deduction, and voting patterns
